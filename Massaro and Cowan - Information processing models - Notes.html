<h1 id="section1">Information Processing Approach:</h1>
<p>While IP is a useful and widely embraced approach to understanding the mind, it has not generally been clearly defined or contrasted with other <em>metatheories</em>. </p>
<h2>Characteristics of the IP approach</h2>
<h3>Five properties of IP approach</h3><a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a>
<h5>Informational descriptions</h5> <p>Means that environment and mental processing can be described in terms of amount and types of information. </p>
<h5 alt="Hirearchical decomposition">Recursive decomposition</h5>
<p>or, <strong>Hierarchical decomposition</strong>. Denotes the breaking down of one stage processing into sub stages. For example a memory stage broken down further into substages.</p>
<h5>Flow Continuity</h5>
<p> States that information is transmitted forward in time. All inputs are necessary to complete one operation are available from the outputs that flow into it.<a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a></p>
<h5>Flow dynamics</h5>
<p>Each stage or opperation takes time.</p>
<p> And finally...</p> <h5>Physical Embodyment</h5>  <p>

...is the assumption that this processing occurs in a physical system. Information is embedded in this system as representation.</p>
<h3> Information</h3>
<p><strong>Information is not identical</strong> to the classic measure. <a href="" class="citation" > Young (1987)</a> defines information as energy, transmitted through the state.<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a> IP Stages transform, but are not changed, by the transmission of information from one stage to another. Visual categorization does not supplant nor is supplanted by a visual representation. The maintenance of multiple representations has been a landmark of short term memory models. Calculation is dodged because it is often not necessary for realization of models.<a href="#4">4</a></p>
<p>Ultimately Massaro and Cowan see information as knowledge within the receiver, where as they see data as within the environment. There's some argument that this means that information is never devoid of meaning as a result. <a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>
<h3>Information Processing</h3>
<blockquote>"The basic notion of IP is that one must trace the progression of information through the system from stimuli to response. (p 386")</blockquote>
<p>Generally IP starts by mapping out a logically necessary sequence of processes. Then experimental models are created to try and manipulate the process. While this is generally conceived as a linear progression <strong> various stages can occur concurrently</strong>. IP as a model for thought allows for powerful analytic techniques to be applied via its metaphorical framework.</p>
<p>Not all researchers using IP as a approach claim that it explains the process underlying behavior. Mental processes have been conceptualized more weakly as intervening variables that permit a parismonious interperitaion of research findings. From this perspective, IP is purely pragmatic in allowing descriptive and perscriptive accounts that would not be possible without metal processes as an intervening variable. Some, such as <a href"" class="ciation">Van der Heijden & Stebbins (1990)</a>, <!--TODO link this--> argue that this is the much less ambitious goal for the IP approach. FOr some authors the only resal which is reasonable is to describe difference in behavior as a function of difference in external and or internal conditions. This more limited goal however requires an explination for how the processes cause behavior <a href="#6" class="footnote">6</a></p>
<p> There are other metatheories. Newell and Simon's Physcial Symbol System view, is more restrictive. Limiting IP to symbolic interaction, however Massaro and Cowan don't restrict it to symbolic interaction. IP Guys don't subscribe to nottiopns of language of thought.</p>
<h2>Justifications of the IP approach</h2>
<p> IP has not often been explicitly justified. Despite a rhetoric of change, it still has many of the best features of behaviorism. As a result many of the strongest features of that approach have been imported. Though there is some differing levels of importance assigned to  concepts has shifted. Behaviorism had aimed ot understand behavior, IP seeks to elucidate the processes that cuase behavior (Hatfield, 1991)<!--TODO Link this-->. IP as an approach attempts to understand the complex by looking at the interaction of simpler processes.</p>
<h4>Constraints on Psychological inquiry</h4>
<p>One way to justify and IP approach is to consider the constraints of psychological inquiry. First, Behavior is cariable and complex. IP's deconstruction, provides some level of parsimony critical to scientific inquiry. Secondly, an assumption of order often clouds the judgement of theorist and researchers. Third, it is difficult to figure out which theory fits which phenomena. There often exists a plethera of options for someone wishing to undrestand how a particular phenomena. </p>
<h4>Implications for Psychological Inquiry</h4>
<p>
  Three charactersistics of IP overcome the three restraints above:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5> Research strategies of falsification</h5>
     Falsification allows for researchers to find which theories are false. This allows the tangle of psychological theories to gradually be disentangled as theories are tested and proven or disproven. There are some critics of this arguing that researchers should nurse rather than falsify, and that the approach leads to modification not rejection.</li>
    <li>
      <h5>Specific and perciese experiments</h5>
      Because predictability is only possible in laboratory condition, theories can only predict the laboratory enviorment.<a href="7" class="footnote">7</a></li>
    <li><h5>Fine Grained Analysis</h5>IP is the only approach that allows for fine enough observations to be made to discount alternative interperitations.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Metatheoretical issues and IP</h2>
<h4>Indentifiablility</h4>
<blockquote>"What may be a weakness of the IP approach concerns whether various explanatory models can be differentitated by experimental results." (p. 390)</blockquote>
<p><a href="" class=citation>E. F. Moore (1956)</a> proved that any input-output function can be mimicked by some other function (via math). No model can excluded all others. While this places a large constraint on what is possible to research with concern to mechanism or process, we can exclude models that are not behaviorally optimal.<a href="#8" class="footnote">8</a></p>
<p><blockquote>"Scientific inquiry can potentially choose among apparently nonidentifable models by extending the empirical data-base, evaluating the models on the basis of parsimony, and testing among viable models using the principles of falsification and strong inference described above." p. 390</blockquote></p>
<p>Experimental research has been able to demonstrate both when parallel and linear processing occurs via an IP approach, and that parallel process do occur. Additionally, experiments have shown that identifying stages and orders remains tricky.</p>
<h4>Proximal v. Distal Causes</h4>
<p>The second thing which situates the model is the causes of behavior. Borrowing from evolutionary biology, behavior is though to have both immediate (proximal), and removed causes (distal). Proximal causes, include psychological causes of behavior. While distal causes concern the adaptive significance of the behavior. Psychologist focus on the proximal aspect of behavior. <a href="#9" class="footnote">9</a> Some pyschologist see distal causes (<em class="note">in this evolutionary context</em>) as a limit for psychological theorizing.</p>
<p>
  This break has led some to proposes that evolutionary distal causes explain gaps in the identifiability of proximal causes. However, Massaro and Cowan find this explaination lacking. Additionally, several papers have found the optimization does not explain the phenomena.<a href="#10" class="footnote">10</a>

    This is a problematic aspect of this approach to information science. Information science relies on complicated search involving information systems in order to understand though. Ultimately though a flow continuity approach nudged a bit side ways to say that rather the output is always the results of the inputs traveling through the system thus ASK and Gaps are explained.

     I'm skeptical of the amount of information being a factor in anything. Complexity and potency might be better ways to think about the facets of information that matter.

    I'm not sure if this may have changed. While the notion of proximal causality is an interesting one, and one that I don't think is far removed from cognitive science, the distal aspect of it generally isn't incorperated into the cognitive study of behavior in the sense the authors use it. The interplay between cognitive and social structures seems like an interesting interpritation of the metaphor.

    The idea of optimization, I think, is a fairly poor one. Though, there is a good adaptation if you explain optimization in a different way. An example of this is the minimal free energy principal, which seats saticficing<!--TODO: spell check this--> in the lens of minimizng (hence optimizing) entropy.
