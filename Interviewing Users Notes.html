     <Strong> Gain insight or arguments.</Strong>Interviewing can be used for either persuation or insight. You can interview users to understand their world, or to validate your ideas. A new product will probably generate enthusaism, but what does that tell you?<a href="#1" class="footnote">1</a><a href="#2" class="footnote">2</a>
   </p>
   <blockquote>
     The insights that come from studying users, not only inform design but also inspire it. (p. 4)

   <p>
     A recounting of the role that user research can play in the design process. <span class="zThoughts"> Fairly standard run down of benefits of user research. Though there is also the following part of the above quote which has some relevance for my own thoughts.</span>
   </p>
   <blockquote>
     Across organizations, different design cultures have more or less appetite for inspirations or information, although in my experience it's hard to interview users with out taking away a hearty does of both. (p 4)
   </blockquote>
   <h2>When to Use Interviewing</h2>
   <p>
     Interviewing is not always a good fit for the problem at hand. It is not well suited for gaining large quantities of answers, howerver it does tend to generate deep data sets about people's eperiences. They aren't good at predicting future behavior<a href="#3" class="footnote">3</a>. Questiosn that ask about future behavior will reveal current mental models<a href="#4" class="footnote">4</a>. Interviewing can be however used in combintion with other methods<a href="#5" class="footnote">5</a>.
   </p>
   <h2>To Interview Well, One Must Study</h2>
   <p>
     If you're going to have interviews that are useful, insightful, and/or persuasive, you have to do your homework.

  <h2>Check Your World View At The Door</h2>
  <p>
    Try to approach the interview with a sense of bland curiosity. Because we have our own assumptions it often helpful to engage in practices to distance ourselves from them.
  </p>
  <h3>The Brian Dump</h3>
  <p>
    At the start of a project. Get people around the table (or asyncronous technology like a wiki) and get what's in their head out into the open. It's important to surface assumptions, expectations, beliefs, hypothotheses, and perspectives. This is not to correct them but to shake up and unsettle what's in our mind. Portigal recommends anonymizing feedback if possible.
