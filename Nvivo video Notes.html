  Work area is made up of 3 panes (called views). Navigation, list, and detail view.
</p>
<h2>Navigation View</h2>
<p>
  Navigation allows for organizations. Under the sources section, there are three tabs. Internals is for stuff that can be imported, like survey responces or interview transcripts. Externals links to ? for objects that can be imported like a hard copy book or a peice of archival film. Memos is memos created by the researcher as they process data.
</p>
<p>
  Also under the navigation view is a nodes folder. This contains cases, and theme nodes. This folder also lets you create hirearchies in your nodes. Classifications let you record facets of soruces, and demographics. Collections give you different ways to organize your materials. Queries are useful ways to return to queries as they are saved here by default.
</p>
<h2> Working with Data</h2>
<p>
  To work with data you can use commands in menu bar and/or the ribbon. Most commands are accessed on the ribbon as well, but NVIVO, FILE, and HELP don't have analogs. Short cut menus can also be accessed by right clicking. This offers controls such as coding snippets of data, and/or exporting or inporting data.
</p>
<h3>Getting to the Data</h3>
  <p>
    When you open a folder, the contents will appear in list view. You can click on the item you want to open in the list view and it will apear in the detailed view. A list of what files are open apears at the bottom of the navigation view. In order to view what has been coded, turn on code stripes. Thematic codes are called nodes.
</p>
<p>
   To add a code to a highlighted section there are a few options. Use the ribon. Use the drop down menu, or right click.

<h1>Video 2 - Import Documents</h1>
<p>
  To import a document, you can do it from the data tab in the control ribbon. Select document option on the import side, and then select the documents you want to import. You can also drag and drop from the finder.
</p>
<p>
   You can create folders within the navigation view to aid in organization, so if you have multiple content types for instance, you can store them seporately. Use the short cut menu (right click) in the navigation view. Then drag and drop items into the newly created folders.

<h1> Video 3 - Code Documents</h1>
<p>
  Nodes are containers of meaning assigned to portions of the text. They can be created using the create tab. When you create a node, you have the option of giving it a description, which can be useful later. NVIVO for mac, can't export these descritions as  a code book, but NVIVO for
