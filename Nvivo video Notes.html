<h1> Video 1</h1>
<p>
  Work area is made up of 3 panes (called views). Navigation, list, and detail view.
</p>
<h2>Navigation View</h2>
<p>
  Navigation allows for organizations. Under the sources section, there are three tabs. Internals is for stuff that can be imported, like survey responses or interview transcripts. Externals links to [?] for objects that can be imported like a hard copy book or a piece of archival film. Memos is memos created by the researcher as they process data.
</p>
<p>
  Also under the navigation view is a nodes folder. This contains cases, and theme nodes. This folder also lets you create hierarchies in your nodes. Classifications let you record facets of sources, and demographics. Collections give you different ways to organize your materials. Queries are useful ways to return to queries as they are saved here by default.
</p>
<h2> Working with Data</h2>
<p>
  To work with data you can use commands in menu bar and/or the ribbon. Most commands are accessed on the ribbon as well, but NVIVO, FILE, and HELP don't have analogs. Short cut menus can also be accessed by right clicking. This offers controls such as coding snippets of data, and/or exporting or importing data.
</p>
<h3>Getting to the Data</h3>
  <p>
    When you open a folder, the contents will appear in list view. You can click on the item you want to open in the list view and it will appear in the detailed view. A list of what files are open appears at the bottom of the navigation view. In order to view what has been coded, turn on code stripes. Thematic codes are called nodes.
</p>
<p>
   To add a code to a highlighted section there are a few options. Use the ribbon. Use the drop down menu, or right click.
</p>
<hr />
<h1>Video 2 - Import Documents</h1>
<p>
  To import a document, you can do it from the data tab in the control ribbon. Select document option on the import side, and then select the documents you want to import. You can also drag and drop from the finder.
</p>
<p>
   You can create folders within the navigation view to aid in organization, so if you have multiple content types for instance, you can store them separately. Use the short cut menu (right click) in the navigation view. Then drag and drop items into the newly created folders.
</p>
<hr />
<h1> Video 3 - Code Documents</h1>
<p>
  Nodes are containers of meaning assigned to portions of the text. They can be created using the create tab. When you create a node, you have the option of giving it a description, which can be useful later. NVIVO for mac, can't export these descriptions as  a code book, but NVIVO 11 for PC can.
</p>
<p>
  It's a good idea to turn on coding stripes when you are coding as it helps you see what you have coded. Highlight the portion of the text, then use one of the options (shortcut, ribbon, or menu) to add a node. We can also add new codes to text, or code from an existing node. <span class="zThoughts"> From the short cut menu there is a quick code option. There is also a hotkey option for the quick code interface as well. </span>
</p>
<hr />
<h1> Video 4 - Review Your Coding</h1>
<p>
  Coding stripes show you the themes that are emerging. You can click on a stripe to show the coded section as highlighted. You can also access more options via the shortcut menu (right click). For example you can uncode. There is a thin density bar as part of the coding stripes visualizations that will show you all the codes apply to an section by hovering.
</p>
<p>
  You can also see the references by opening the node. You can navigate back to the text used from the node section. You can also show context around the coded node. The summary tab will show you how the code is applied across documents at a high level.
</p>
<hr />
<h1> Video 5 - Create Memos</h1>
<p>
  Memos can be created to document your work and thoughts as they happen. This allows you tell the story of your project. They can help you show your development.
</p>
<p>
  How to create a memo? Create a memo. There is a thing that lets you do it on the ribbon, but you can also link a memo to your text using the shortcut bar. The ribbon shifts when you are writing a note so that you can stylize the text. You can also insert an image into these memos.
</p>
<p>
  You can continue to add content to your memo as you go. You have to click the edit button after the initial submission.
</p>
<hr />
<h1> Video 6 - Organize Your Nodes</h1>
<p>
  You can arrange your nodes, and order them in a hierarchy. When you create nodes, you can drag and drop. You can assign relationships while you create a new node. Highlight and shortcut menu expedites things. There are also ways to sort via facets in the list view.
</p>
<hr />
<h1>Video 7 - Organize Your Demographic Data</h1>
<p>
  In order to keep track of demographic data, and attributes you can use the case classification option, to create a case type with attributes.  Then you can code each interview to with the subjects case from the list option, then you can open the case classification. Then you can assign values as a spreadsheet in the detailed view. Also you can filter based on cases and attributes in the feature.
</p>
<hr />
<h1> Video 8 - Run a Tex Search Query</h1>
<p>
  You can use a text query to see how participants use words. There is a query tab on the ribbon. Detailed view will show the sources with the phrase. To see all the coded references in one place click the reference tab in the detail view. You can adjust the context using the short cut menu. You can save the results as a new node. You can also see  a word tree, which is a visual showing context webs.
</p>
<hr />
<h1>Video 9 - Query Coding</h1>
<p>
  Code queries, can help you explore the content that's been coded, test your code, or draw connections between the teams. Coded queries are also under the query tab. It lets you pull codes where there are interactions happening. You can also use case categorization in this stage.
</p>
<hr />
<h1>Video 10 - Windows/Mac Interoperability</h1>
<p>
  You can use windows project and use it in Mac, as long as you're using version 10.5.0 or later. If this has happened then you can save as and convert it on the Windows computer. Because Mac has less features, some facets may not appear.
</p>
<hr />
<h1> Video 11 - Run a Matrix Query</h1>
<p>
  Matrix queries let you coded material across demographics and themes. This can help patterns emerge. IE comparing what men and women have to say across a range of issues. It is a drag and drop interface in the detailed view. Several submenus well be available. Running the query shows count and facet. You can also add colors.  You can save your query and results as option in the detail view. You can double click on the row to pull up the content coded at the node.
</p>
<hr />
<h1>Video 12 - Transcribing in NVIVO</h1>
<p>
  Transcription can be done in NVIVO. Click on an imported file. Player controls, a video window, and a wav form with time stamps will appear in the list view. The box to enter edit mode will appear in the list view not the detail view.
</p>
<p>
  You can adjust the play speed. The track head in the wave from can be used to jump around the recording. There are keyboard short cuts.
  Play/pause, skipping, etc. are detailed in the table below.
</p>
<p>
  After a speaker has stopped, or if the topic of conversation has changed you can add a new row, which will allow for attributes like speaker to be assigned, and a new timestamp will start where the last bit ended. You can synchronize the transcript with the video. You can also loop, to a particular section.
</p>

<h1> Video 13 - Annotating in NVIVO</h1>
 <p>
   Annotations are like notes in the margins. They let you create reminders, notes, etch in the text. You can create them from the analyze tab or shortcut menu based on highlighted text. You can see who created the note, and when it was created. You can see them a separate data points, you can also search them. Shift+Command+A will create an annotation.
 </p>
 <hr />
 <h1>Video 14 - Import spreadsheets</h1>
 <p>
   You can import a spreadsheet as a dataset. It's good to clean up the sheet ahead of time as you can't edit the dataset in NVIVO once it's imported. Check to ensure that the data is being interpreted properly before finalizing the import. NVIVO will provide options for each column. Once you import you will not be able to import.
 </p>
 <p>
   Datasets of more then 100 entries are stored as separate pages.
