<h1>Chapter 2 Notes</h1>

<blockquote>
  "Beneath surface irregularities of designers' modes of operation, common information-handling procedures can be identified. (p. 39)"
</blockquote>

<p>
  From here, Rowe, brings us to the fact that those interested in design can use the tools of psychology (particularly those concerned with cognition). In chapter 2 he examines the contributions that different schools of psychological thought can play in understanding designing and problem solving.
</p>
<p>
  Rowe sets out two interseting thoughts here:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Bounded rationality:</strong> There is a limit to what can be understood about a problem, hense we are only able to think up a finite number of solutions, and choose the one that best satisfices, or statisfies the most facets of the problem.<a href="#10" id="f1" class="footnote">1</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Design is problem solving:</strong> in many ways in line with Simon's (1968) definition: Design is the process of changing the "existing situation into a preferred one." Rowe, however, uses Thorndike (1931) to construct his definition. Thorndike: A problem is a situation where an organism has a desire, but the means of obtaining that design are not immediately clear<a href="#11" id="f1" class="footnote">2</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>General Characteristics of Design Problems</h2>
<p>
   Design problems can be categorized as well defined, ill defined, and wicked<a href="#12" id="f1" class="footnote">3</a>. <strong>Well defined</strong> design problems, are simple tasks, and are heavily constrained, creating a hero image for a site, or some other simple graphic design within brand constraints would be one example. <stong>Ill defined problems</stong> are more open and require more investigation. This might be something like a logo redesign, or website redesign. The designer must spend significant amounts of time and energy to understand and bound the problem. <strong> Wicked problems</strong>  are social problems/cultural problems. <strong>These problems are by their very nature unsolvable by design.</strong><a href="#13" id="f1" class="footnote">4</a> However, some designers have developed processes that form almost a set of cultural consulting services that aim to bridge the gap between social problem and technological/branding solution. IDEO's work might be an example of this sort of service set.
</p>
<h2>Historical Thoughts on Design Thinking</h2>
<p>
  This chapter lays out a considerable amount of the history of the study of creative problem solving. There are interesting facets of these movements contributions to the body of understanding of how designers thing, in particular the explanation of the Gestalt Movement's contribution. As much time is spent laying out a strong case for the application of information processing as the current dominate and orthodox understanding of design thinking.
</p>
<p>

<h2>The Information Processing perspective</h2>
  <p>
  The IP view as characterized by Rowe, has several facets. However, Early work postulated that information in the design process was the result of a problem space. The design agent had a set of knowledge states the represented possible solutions or avenues to deal with the problem state (ie avoidance). In this model there are one or more generative process that allow the agent to apply their knowledge state to the problem space and generate new knowledge states. Thus changing the problem state. Then test procedures are used to compare the knowledge states to the presumed solution. Finally, further processes allow this to be repeated, until enough changed has happened results in knowledge states that align enough that the original problem state is resolved.</p>
  <p>
     Of course there are other factors and behaviors noted below, as this model is just one early supposition as to the process of design cognition.
  </p>
  <h3>Problem solving behavior</h3>
  <p>
  Generally, cognitive activities are observed through behavior. These behaviors are characterized by Rowe as <em>Problem Representation, Solution Generation, and Solution Evaluation.</em><a href="#14" id="f1" class="footnote">5</a>
  </p>
  <h4>Trial-and-Error</h3>
  <p>
    In its purest form, trial-and-error involve finding a solution to a problem in an entirely random manner. However, it's strongly thought that no trial-and-error process is truly random, as they are always situated within some previous knowledge, and necessitates some knowledge of the solution. These previous sets of knowledge provide some bounds for the problem itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trial-and-error is typically characterized as the independent testing and evaluation of prototypes, where prototypes are created and tested, if they fail the intermediate result is discarded and a new solution is create from scratch. An example of this would be if you were attempting a jigsaw puzzle, and every time a piece didn't fit, you started over from scratch. As a result this tends to occur when the scope of a problem is overwhelming, and/or unstable, so that tests generate very little information or understanding to go on.

      Brown splits ill-defined problems to create the category of wicked problem. <span class=zThoughts> I think that web design may have a different contextual divide than Rowe lays out for architecture and urban planning. See footnote 9.</span>

      This section is a little bit confusing for me. It seems as though Rowe is balancing between describing the science around the behavior and the behaviors as techniques that can be apple
